CMPG323 Website CV Project

Hello World!

Welcome To my website cv

The website has everything that a cv should have, about me, work experiences, skills, qualifications and contact me

I also went for a matrix theme to express my self a bit 

The website is made with HTML CSS, windtail css, and javascript

For the fun of it I also added a flappy bird game, its a bit janky as I ran out of time but it is working, you just have to click the Bored? butoon to start playing, to play it 
you should click with your mouse.

For the rest of the the website everything is done on one page, you can either scroll down or use the top nav to navigate yourself to the differant parts of the website

Hope you enjoy it!
The website is also mobile friendly, try it out!
